# CRTC Toolkit

The CRTC Toolkit provides a series of applications which allow for annotating and collecting individual cells from microscopy images, segmenting those cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic regions, and performing data analysis using the relative expression levels of CRTC in each region. The toolkit is provided as a set of compiled MATLAB apps, with source code available for modification and further scripting of the pipeline and workflows.
